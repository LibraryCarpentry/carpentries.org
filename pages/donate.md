excerpt: Support our work by donating directly to The Carpentries
---
<p>
  We are funded by a wide variety of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/members/">supporting organisations</a>,
  by workshop administration fees,
  and by <a href="{{site.fundraising_link}}">direct donations</a>
  from people like you.</p>
  
 <p>Donating even a small amount can make a big difference. New funding allows The Carpentries to expand into new geographies and new disciplines, and can help bring workshops to researchers who might otherwise be locked out of participation.
