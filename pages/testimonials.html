  <p> "I would really 100% recommend the Data Carpentry workshop because it showed me a tech-savvy and efficient way to handle and store my research data using R software. I also learnt a lot about data capturing which greatly helped me in undertaking my research."</p>

  <p>"I enjoyed the Carpentries training and it was a first for me. I can recommend it to anyone how want to learn more... "</p>

  <p>"My experience was good. The instructors were accommodating and never left a person behind. They were always willing to have a catch-up session if you did not understand something and also engaged in the various research data we use. I appreciate the helpers a lot and they were helpful from beginning to the end. I learnt a lot from the workshop and I was confident to resume using Rstudio, after failed attempts. "</p>

  <p>"I had no prior experience with R or OpenRefine, so I was curious how a one week workshop could get me started with the needed skills in effectively using those tools. The workshop instructors were patient and down-to-earth. They took the time to explain the basic concepts and made room for participants to ask questions. They even stayed behind after the 4 and half hour sessions each day to support individuals who needed some extra help. The exercises between lessons provided opportunities for us to test what we were learning as we went along â€” the live coding sessions were my favourite."</p>

  <p>"The Carpentries workshop is quite exciting and informative. The teachers were very friendly and approachable. I attended the R software and it has formed one of my research tools.
  I have written a journal article to be submitted soon and the analysis was done using R."</p>

  <p>"I am very thankful for the programme that you are running, it is through your workshop that I was able to have a better understanding of what to do with my data. The workshop presentations helped me understand the basics of doing statistics and I currently use some of the scripts to help me through my data as thus I would definitely recommend for anyone who wants to learn to attend your workshops"</p>

<p>Software Carpentry training has had a tremendous influence on the productivity of the students in my lab and several other labs on campus.It trained them to write code that works properly more quickly and to automate repetitive tasks that they used to spend hours on (now they spend minutes). In addition, we are now reusing code much more often, because the code is written in such a way that the students can remember what they did and other students can understand exactly how the code works. I can't recommend Software Carpentry strongly enough.</p>

<p>Data Carpentry opened up a whole new world for me. I was doing Biology during my undergraduate studies, which didn't include any formal training in computational skills. Suddenly, I was drowning in big data during my postgrad and had no clue how to work with this type of data. Since attending my first Carpentry workshop, I have learned most of the tools taught by The Carpentries, qualified as an instructor, and have taught at five Data Carpentry workshops, as well as three one-day R workshops. Obviously, I am now very passionate about teaching these tools to researchers who find themselves in the same situation I did. I also feel confident and competent to analyze various types of data, which helped gain me a post-doctoral fellowship in Pharmaceutics.</p>

<p>My labmates and I attended a Software Carpentry workshop a few months ago,
  and since then, several graduate students and RAs have been much more willing
  to tackle simple programming tasks independently. We have also now implemented
  a version control repository in the lab: it has greatly reduced the number of
  files flying around and helped to ensure that everyone in the lab has the most
  up-to-date versions of all the code we routinely use. Its history mechanism
  also keeps us from having to manually document every change made or analysis
  done, which has greatly improved our ability to find information quickly.</p>

</summary>
<p>As a nuclear engineer at the US national labs, the number of nuclear safety
  and performance codes I see which are practically untested, basically
  undocumented, and completely lacking in version control is alarming. New
  projects are starting to incorporate better practices, but over and over
  again, students and new staff members show up ready to implement advanced
  numerical methods but don't have a handle on version control. I've found that
  the time it takes to train new researchers to adopt essential software
  practices is vastly reduced by the workshops and online resources provided by
  Software Carpentry. By directing colleagues to the online lectures instead of
  teaching them individually to test and version control their code I've
  personally saved a great number of hours and they've been spared just as many
  false starts.</p>

<p>As a self-taught programmer, Software Carpentry gave me the tools to plan
  better code before even picking up a keyboard&mdash;improving my ability to
  expand, re-use, and test what I develop. The result is a more reliable, better
  traceable product, and I have a better sense of what to look for when
  evaluating other tools.</p>

<p>Armed with a single introductory C++ course, I did a master's degree and
    several years of consulting work on spatial simulation models before taking
    Software Carpentry. Long, slow, frustrating experience left me well prepared
    to appreciate this course. What has changed? I work more quickly, and re-use
    my own code; I find more errors, and spend less time fixing them; I trust my
    results more; I don't mind revisiting and revising old work; collaborators and
    potential employers are more impressed; and I'm happier.</p>

<p>I started working at the Space Science Lab last November
  focusing on QA for two satellite projects' flight software.
  While I have written and tested lots of software in the past, I
  was unfamiliar with Python which is the preferred language for
  software testing here at the lab.  The workshop gave me the
  tools to start to feel competent in my new job.</p>

<p>
  My involvement with Software Carpentry as an workshop instructor
  and lesson contributor has allowed me to pursue new career paths; most
  notably, my current position at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
  As a Software Carpentry instructor, I gained valuable cross-discipline
  experience: communicating difficult concepts to non-experts, developing
  skills in computing tools, collaborating with a team, and demonstrating
  my commitment to better computing skills by volunteering my time.  My
  involvement with Software Carpentry also introduced me to a unique
  professional community of people who care about research and computing,
  which is typically not found in a single university/lab/office.  This
  community has introduced me to new ideas, tools, and job postings from
  off the beaten path.

<p>Software Carpentry helped me to explore the ways in which I improve and
  maintain my code. This made it easier for me to look back upon my old work and
  adapt it for new purposes, thereby making my research progress more
  quickly. It has also let me ask types of questions that I previously had no
  ability to address.</p>

<p>I depend on the techniques taught in this course to maintain reliable
  programs, scripts and data organisation. The time management, revision
  control, debugging and testing strategies are absolutely essential to build
  and maintain my projects. The basic Unix, shell, and scripting skills save me
  significant time and effort every day. It's an invaluable resource for

<p>Like most psychology students, I got no formal training in computational
  methods during my undergrad or graduate program. This meant that I was
  effectively cut off from the tool I was using and pessimistic about my chances
  of ever mastering it. Software Carpentry demystified programming for me and
  also gave me a solid background in software development practices. I now use
  tools that I never would have considered before taking the course, and have
  even accepted a postdoc in a computation-heavy lab, which would have been out
  of the question. My only regret is that I wasn't able to take this course
  earlier in my degree!</p>

<p>Deadline after deadline: research life is as simple as that. As a
  consequence, research software is too often written in a rush. How many of you
  have faced that little, tricky, hidden bug a few days before submission? If
  you did, you also know that feeling of mistrust of your code. Software
  Carpentry showed me how easy and rewarding it is to write code that is
  testable from very early stages: write a little function, and immediately
  check whether simple examples yield the results you expect. And while
  Subversion repositories are not so easy to set up, once they are working, it's
  like having a perfect lab assistant to tell you what is going on at any
  time.</p>

<p>Before I attended the Software Carpentry workshop, I honestly didn't think
  I'd pick up anything useful other than a few minor tips and tricks because I
  had been programming for over 6 years at that point. Much to my surprise,
  Software Carpentry transformed the way I approach programming. I learned how
  to write better, flexible software with command-line options; the importance
  of open-source, reusable software in research; and was introduced to the best
  research notebook I've encountered so far: IPython Notebook. I couldn't
  recommend Software Carpentry enough, even for the veteran programmers out
  there.</p>

  I was a physicist in a biology lab, working mostly with
  biologist with little or no knowledge of programming.  What
  Software Carpentry taught completely changed our way of
  working. It was hard to understand at first why seemingly
  simple tasks sometimes took longer, but after a few weeks we
  were able to automate days of work so that we could have a
  coffee break and brainstorm on the actual science. This
  completely changed the way we envisioned studies, from
  limiting ourself to what a student could manually analyze to
  collecting as much data as possible in order to investigate
  modification of mouse Oocytes maturation at timescales we
  wouldn't have looked at.  And even though we didn't have deep
  training in some topics, just knowing that things like regular
  expressions existed allowed the team to consult experts. This
  allowed us to structure the way we did experiments and store
  data in better ways, which in turn made getting new team
  members up to speed much easier.
