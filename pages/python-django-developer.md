[The Carpentries](http://carpentries.org/) is committed to “training and
fostering an active, inclusive, diverse community of learners and instructors
who promote and model the importance of software and data in research.” We seek
an engaged and collaborative individual who shares this vision for a contractor
or short-term position as a Python/Django Developer for The Carpentries. The
Python/Django Developer has a broad responsibility for maintaining and
developing new features in [AMY](https://github.com/carpentries/amy), the web
application that manages data on our community members and workshops.

As a Python/Django Developer, you will work closely with the lead developer on
AMY, the Infrastructure Team and the Workshop Administration Team, to improve
the existing code base and implement new features. AMY is built using Django and
relies on the following tools and technologies: Docker, Redis, PostgreSQL, AWS,
jQuery, bootstrap, select2.

The Carpentries is an open, global community teaching the skills and
perspectives to turn data into knowledge. We build capacity in essential data
and computational skills for conducting efficient, open, and reproducible
research. We believe in a world where more people have the computational skills
and perspectives to work with data to address their questions in science,
scholarship and society. We aim to build that world by scaling evidence-based
teaching, creating inclusive environments, and building communities of practice
based on open principles. In this role, you will join a diverse team of
professionals working to spread data-driven research skills. Our community
comprises approximately 85,000 learners, 3,700 instructors, 150 Trainers, and 100 partner organisations from research institutions around the world.

## Qualifications

We are not expecting in-depth experience with all qualifications of the
position, but given that only a very small team works on AMY, the Developer will
need at least a working knowledge of most of the tools and technologies used by
AMY.

### Requirements


* Excellent written and real-time communication skills
* Ability to work remotely with a distributed team
* Experience with Git and GitHub
* Experience with writing tested, production grade Python and Django
* Commercial knowledge and practice of Linux, Docker, and AWS


### Preferred

* Experience with The Carpentries
* Experience with PostgreSQL, Redis
* Experience with CI/CD workflows
* Experience with UX and front-end libraries (especially Bootstrap)

Our team values openness, honesty, fairness, and transparency as the keys to
fostering trust. We believe that the individuals who make up our community are
the most important part of our organisation and our strongest resource. We
strive to make decisions that prioritize people first and empower the growth and
success of all who are part of our organisation. We value a growth mindset in
all that we do and strive to be always improving and evolving ourselves and our
methodologies, being receptive to feedback, responsive, curious, and willing to
learn.
