The Director of Technology has a broad responsibility for leading the maintenance and development of The Carpentries technical

The Carpentries is an open, global community teaching the skills and perspectives to turn data into knowledge. We build capacity 
in essential data and computational skills for conducting efficient, open, and reproducible research. We believe in a world where
more people have the computational skills and perspectives to work with data to address their questions in science, scholarship
