## Where Do I Get Started?

Glad you asked! [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/about/) is an organisation that relies on volunteer contributions to support the [community of practice](https://carpentries.org/community/) whose members share [our core values](https://carpentries.org/values/). We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people. By participating in this community, participants accept to abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/index_coc.html). Whether you have a little or a lot of time, there are many ways to contribute and engage with us.

### Chat with Other Community Members

[The Carpentries Slack](http://swcarpentry.slack.com) is where our community members connect with each other, and where we share resources and opportunities to participate. If Slack is new to you, our [Slack Quickstart Guide](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/tools/slack-and-email.html#slack-quick-start-guide) will help you to set up your profile and workspace, and give you an overview of how we use the platform on a day-to-day basis. All new members to Slack are automatically added to the following Slack channels:

- [#general](https://swcarpentry.slack.com/archives/C03LE48AY): main channel to discuss all things Carpentries, excluding recruitment of workshop volunteers. Everyone can post here.
- [#welcome](https://swcarpentry.slack.com/archives/CB35ZV9KL): where new members post short bios about themselves. You’re encouraged to say hello to others here!
- [#jobs](https://swcarpentry.slack.com/archives/CD099JB5X): where you can find job opportunities relevant to our community members.  
We also have over 100 optional channels, ranging from local and regional communities (e.g., [#local-japan](https://swcarpentry.slack.com/archives/CLR96JCBS)) to channels supporting specific volunteer roles (e.g., [#instructors](https://swcarpentry.slack.com/archives/C08BVNU00)). Not sure which channels to follow? You can find additional information about our Slack Channels in [our Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/tools/slack-and-email.html).
