We are happy that you are here! This document is intended to help you get started in The Carpentries community by highlighting some key links and activities. If you have questions, please get in touch with our Director of Community, Alycia Crall, by [email](mailto:alycia@carpentries.org) or [schedule a meeting](https://calendly.com/alycia-carpentries).

## Where Do I Get Started?

Glad you asked! [The Carpentries](/about/) is an organisation that relies on volunteer contributions to support the [community of practice](/community/) whose members share [our core values]({{site.handbook_url}}/values/). We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people. By participating in this community, participants accept to abide by our [Code of Conduct]({{site.handbook_url}}/topic_folders/policies/index_coc.html). Whether you have a little or a lot of time, there are many ways to contribute and engage with us.

### Chat with Other Community Members

[The Carpentries Slack](https://swcarpentry.slack.com) ([you can create an account by following this link](https://swc-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/)) is where our community members connect with each other, and where we share resources and opportunities to participate. If Slack is new to you, our [Slack Quickstart Guide]({{site.handbook_url}}/topic_folders/communications/tools/slack-and-email.html#slack-quick-start-guide) will help you to set up your profile and workspace, and give you an overview of how we use the platform on a day-to-day basis. All new members to Slack are automatically added to the following Slack channels:

- [#general](https://swcarpentry.slack.com/archives/C03LE48AY): main channel to discuss all things Carpentries, excluding recruitment of workshop volunteers. Everyone can post here.
- [#welcome](https://swcarpentry.slack.com/archives/CB35ZV9KL): where new members post short bios about themselves. You’re encouraged to say hello to others here!
- [#jobs](https://swcarpentry.slack.com/archives/CD099JB5X): where you can find job opportunities relevant to our community members.  
We also have over 100 optional channels, ranging from local and regional communities (e.g., [#local-japan](https://swcarpentry.slack.com/archives/CLR96JCBS)) to channels supporting specific volunteer roles (e.g., [#instructors](https://swcarpentry.slack.com/archives/C08BVNU00)). Not sure which channels to follow? You can find additional information about our Slack Channels in [our Handbook]({{site.handbook_url}}/topic_folders/communications/tools/slack-and-email.html).
