At The Carpentries we are "[Always Learning](https://carpentries.org/values/)". We embody the [growth mindset we teach](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/08-motivation.html#encourage-a-growth-mindset) using data and community feedback to measure our impact and foster continuous improvement.

#### Other Assessment-Related Publications

[When Do Workshops Work? A Response to the 'Null Effects' paper from Feldon _et al_.(2017)](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/12/response-null-effects.html)
_Author:_ Karen R. Word. _Contributors:_ Kari Jordan, Erin Becker, Jason Williams, Pamela Reynolds, Amy Hodge, Maxim Belkin, Ben Marwick, and Tracy Teal.

> This was a collaborative response to the paper: Feldon, David F. _et al._ [Null effects of boot camps and short-format training for PhD students in life sciences](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5604013/) _Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A_. 2017 Sep 12; 114(37): 9854–9858. doi:  10.1073/pnas.1705783114. Our data suggest that we are having a positive impact, and we expect that other short-format programs can be similarly effective.

[Webinar with Rochelle Tractenberg: Debrief (2018)](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2018/03/tractenberg-summary.html)

> The [Assessment Network]({{site.url}}/assessment-network/) held a webinar with Rochelle Tractenberg. Dr. Tractenberg directs the Collaborative for Research on Outcomes and Metrics at Georgetown University, where she is a tenured professor in the Department of Neurology. Our starting point was the controversy about short-format training which arose last year, following the publication of a 2017 _PNAS_ paper titled ["Null effects of boot camps and short-format training for PhD students in life sciences"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5604013/). The Carpentries design and deliver short-format training for working with software and data; trainees are researchers from various fields. The Carpentries’ [initial response](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/12/response-null-effects.html) to the paper discussed many ways in which we have been successful with respect to our goals for Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry workshops. However, given that short-format training is a known challenge for generating sustainable content learning, we hoped that Dr. Tractenberg’s expertise might shed some light on areas with room for improvement.
