excerpt: The Instructor Development Committee helps new and established Instructors.
---

The Instructor Development Committee (formerly known as the **Mentoring Subcommittee**) supports Instructors as they progress 
through training, teaching, curriculum development,
and other community-related activities. They help promote community-building and networking, by 
providing virtual spaces where instructors from all over the world can share teaching success stories and 
discuss teaching strategies. For more about our work, [see this section of The Carpentries Handbook]({{site.handbook_url}}/topic_folders/instructor_development/index.html).

**_Our Goal:_**    
To support Instructors in our community through a range of activities. 

**_Our Approach:_**    
We run regular [instructor discussion sessions](https://pad.carpentries.org/instructor-discussion) where people preparing to teach can ask for advice. People who have recently taught can use the sessions to debrief.

**_Our Structure:_**    
The Committee has monthly meetings, which are open to new members. Meetings are scheduled, organised, and 
run through this [etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/instructor-development).
For more about committee roles, see the [Handbook]({{site.handbook_url}}/topic_folders/instructor_development/instructor_development_committee.html). We also organise information about our work though this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/carpentries/mentoring).
