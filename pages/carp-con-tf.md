The CarpentryCon Task Force mission is to organise and host a meeting every two years to bring together members of the global Carpentries community and people with similar interests. 

**_Our Goal:_**       
To organise an event that will bring together and skill up members of the global Carpentries community and people with similar interests.

**_Our Approach:_**    
Starting approximately nine months before the next scheduled conference dates, the Task Force holds monthly meetings. At the moment, we are planning a virtual CarpentryCon in 2022. We are currently seeking volunteers to [join the Task Force](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSex5YLDI6RA_KFeenPzW6Tsy3A0fUcCZLXtCxWlYuY4qhm6oA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

**_Our Structure:_**       
The Task Force has monthly meetings, which are open to new members.
