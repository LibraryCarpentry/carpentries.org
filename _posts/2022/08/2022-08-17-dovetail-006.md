This is the sixth post in a series that we are calling "The Dovetail."
In this series, we aim to keep members of The Carpentries community abreast of
the current news for [The Carpentries Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/workbench). 

If you are interested in participating in discussions around The Carpentries
Workbench, head over to our GitHub Discussions forum: <https://github.com/carpentries/workbench/discussions>

## Announcements

A lot has happened since the last time I provided an update (2022-07-20), just
not that much on The Workbench side of things. I atteneded and presented at
RStudio conference 2022, took a short staycation to decompress (with a broken 
aircon, no less!) and attended and presented at CarpentryCon 2022. During the
down time, I was able to tackle some small aspects of The Workbench that could
be done without a major rewrite. 

Something that struck me during this time: I have done a not-that-great job at
communicating about what's been going on with The Workbench. I noticed that in 
the sessions, many people were not quite sure what The Workbench was or even
what problem it is solving. This lack of awareness is a bit of a problem because
this change affects the entire community as a whole, and it is 100% on me that
the word has not gotten out in a bigger way. In some ways, this is entirely
on-brand for me as an introvert who is prone to anxiety, but really, as a
former host of a [weekly radio
show](https://blogs.oregonstate.edu/inspiration/) that helped grad students
communicate their research, I should know better. So, starting today, I will get
better at communicating and coordinating this project. 

In the coming weeks, I am going to be reaching out to, and coordinating with the
Instructor and Trainer leadership to make sure that communications go out to
these communities in a way that make sense to them. 

### Workbench Beta Phase On Hold

Just in case you did not see [The Dovetail issue number 5]({{ site.url }}/blog/2022/07/dovetail-005), the Beta phase has been put on hold so that the team could focus on time-sensitive events such as CarpentryCon and hiring for two positions. 

### Upcoming Workbench Events

#### RSECon2022 (September 2022)

Toby Hodges and I will be leading a short workshop at 
[The Conference for Research Software Engineering](https://rsecon2022.society-rse.org/) 
entitled "Collaborative Lesson Development with The
Carpentries Workbench" where we will go over the principles of lesson
development and how to use The Workbench to employ those principles. 


## Updates to The Carpentries Workbench

   - minor update for an internal function to prepare for the CRAN release of [{tinkr}](https://docs.ropensci.org/tinkr).

To update your local Workbench installation, open R and use the following code:

```r
# Enable repository from carpentries
options(repos = c(
  ropensci = 'https://carpentries.r-universe.dev',
  CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
# Download and install sandpaper in R
install.packages(c('tinkr', 'pegboard', 'sandpaper', 'varnish'))
```
