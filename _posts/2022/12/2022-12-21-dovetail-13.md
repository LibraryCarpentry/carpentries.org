## Updates to The Carpentries Workbench

Since 2022-12-06, 

 - [{sandpaper} version 0.11.2 -> 0.11.3](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper/news/index.html#sandpaper-0113)
   - Workflows have been updated to avoid [false alarm pull request comments](https://github.com/carpentries/lesson-development-training/pull/165#issuecomment-1337182275)
     triggered by commits pushed to a PR in rapid succession. With this update,
     running workflows will give precedence to new workflows created with new
     pushes.
 - [{pegboard} 0.3.2](https://carpentries.github.io/pegboard/news/index.html#pegboard-032)
   - no updates :)
 - [{varnish} 0.2.10 -> 0.2.11](https://carpentries.github.io/varnish/news/index.html#varnish-0211)
   - Printing of lesson pages is better formatted for teaching by expanding
     solutions and instructor notes, adding boxes around callouts, and removing
     extraneous navigational content.

To update your local Workbench installation, open R and use the following code:

```r
# Enable repository from carpentries
options(repos = c(
  ropensci = 'https://carpentries.r-universe.dev',
  CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
# Download and install sandpaper in R
install.packages(c('tinkr', 'pegboard', 'sandpaper', 'varnish'))
```
