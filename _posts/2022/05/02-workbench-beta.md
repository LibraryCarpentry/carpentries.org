   alt="Diagram of three phases of the beta release. At the top is box labelled 'current' that contains a github logo, a cartoon of a lesson page. Below is a box labelled 'Pre Beta' with the same contents as the box above plus an additional github logo in blue with a camera above it (to indicate a snapshot) and a new cartoon of a lesson page with a padlock over it. There is a clock indicating a timeframe of four weeks. The next box below is labelled 'Beta'. The GitHub logo has become blue and there is a lightning bolt and a line connecting it to the previous logo, indicating that a transformation happened. A smaller, grey github logo is adjacent with a lock over it, indicating that it is archived. The  old lesson page now has a lock and information symbol above it. The new lesson page does not have any symbols above it. The timreframe is 6 to 8 weeks. The final box is titled 'Release Candidate' and has a single blue github logo, a faded old lesson page, and a new lesson page with a timeframe of 6 months"/>
