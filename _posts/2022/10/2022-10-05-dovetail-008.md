This is the eighth post in [a series that we are calling "The Dovetail",
about the transition to The Carpentries Workbench](https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-dovetail).
In this series, we aim to keep members of The Carpentries community abreast of
the current news about [the Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/workbench). 

If you are interested in participating in discussions around The Carpentries
Workbench, head over to our GitHub Discussions forum: <https://github.com/carpentries/workbench/discussions>

As we enter into the Q4, I am pleased to announce that the long-delayed Beta
Phase will commence from 2022-10-17 until 2023-03-13 with one lesson entering
the beta phase per week. Details of the beta phase and the official table of
lessons can be found [on the Workbench Beta Phase page](https://carpentries.github.io/workbench/beta-phase.html).
