# Changes to Instructor Checkout

Starting today, there are more options available for trainees to complete the process of certifying as a Carpentries Instructor! 

Summary of the updated checkout process:
* [Teaching Demonstration requires less preparation](#Teaching-Demonstration)
* [Attend a Welcome Session](#Community-Discussion--gt-Welcome-Session), a new type of community discussion focused on new community members
* [Get Involved with the Carpentries in any way that suits you](#Lesson-Contribution--gt-%E2%80%9CGet-Involved%E2%80%9D-Step) (no longer limited to lesson contributions!)

## Why make changes to the Instructor Checkout process?
[In 2022, Kelly Barnes led a project team to evaluate the existing checkout process](https://carpentries.org/blog/2022/09/checkout-project/). This included extensive conversations and focus groups across our communities. 

The project team reviewed the feedback shared during this assessment and generated a set of recommended changes. These recommendations were shared for discussion with the Trainer community, which oversees changes to our Instructor Training program, after which they were [submitted to Trainers Leadership for approval](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues/226). 

Preparing for these changes has taken time, and we still are not able to pursue all of the changes recommended based on community feedback. However, the Carpentries database (AMY), documentation, and Trainer community are finally ready to roll out the most important elements: changes to trainee requirements to receive certification.


## What has changed?

### Teaching Demonstration
A teaching demonstration is an online session where trainees perform 5-minutes of teaching, receive feedback, and share feedback for others. Teaching demos are hosted by Carpentries certified Instructor Trainers, who report this step as "passed" when have successfully demonstrated essential Carpentries teaching practices.

[Rob: I think the "previously" and "now" should put the change in bold at the start of each section here...]
**Previously: Trainees were required to prepare to teach the full lesson prior to performing their teaching demonstration.** The Trainer hosting the session would then select a starting point within the lesson during the demonstration. This supported Instructor preparation for their first teaching experience, but it also made the demo more challenging and created inequities among lessons based on the number of usable episodes they contained. 
**Now: Trainees will now be allowed to select a specific episode (or section of a lesson) with live coding, or other participatory content, to present at their demo.** Since the primary purpose of the teaching demonstration is to evaluate teaching practices, it was determined that this can be evaluated without asking trainees to prepare every episode in a  lesson. **** [Eli: changed "any" to "a specific" - trying to be clearer from this sentence alone that the preparation burden is reduced.]

This will reduce the stress of preparing for the teaching demonstration and allow trainees to focus on their teaching style.

### Community Discussion -> Welcome Session
"Community Discussion" describes many types of events hosted through The Carpentries. A Welcome Session is a specific type of Community Discussion that serves as an onboarding for new community members.

**Previously: Community Discussion was optional as a part of checkout.** Any type of community meeting or event could fulfill this requirement. This resulted in inconsistent experiences that did not always match the goals of this step, which were to support Instructors in joining the community and preparing to teach.
**Now: Welcome Sessions will be specifically required as a part of checkout.** Welcome sessions are designed to onboard new community-members to The Carpentries community. Welcome sessions have been expanded to offer more time slots and include an breakout session especially for new Instructors.

*Note: Other community events will continue to be accepted towards checkout as part of our "Get Involved" step (more on this below).* 

<!--- Consider adding a link to upcoming Welcome Session calendar. NB: this will need to be updated on an annual basis, if the 2023 qualifier convention continues. Currently there are no Welcome sessions for Q3 accessible to AUNZ timezones. Possibly this could be raised in an upcoming community subcommittee quarterly meeting.

### Lesson Contribution -> "Get Involved" Step
A "lesson contribution" includes many forms of engagement on and off GitHub, but is narrowly directed at participating in maintenance and improvement of Carpentries materials. There are now many more ways to "get involved" with The Carpentries for this step!

**Previously: Trainees were required to make a contribution to the content or conversation around our lessons and other resources on GitHub.** This was intended to support Instructors in learning to share feedback that contributes to the maintenance of our materials. However, many trainees found this step to be a barrier to completing checkout, and we could not find clear evidence that that this step was achieving its intended goals. 
**Now: Lesson contributions will no longer be required, but will continue to be welcomed as part of the checkout process.** The "Get Involved" step allows Trainees to choose from a variety of options, with the goal that they will take the next step in their involvement in The Carpentries community. Any participation will be accepted, but we suggest one of the following activities:
- [ ] Serve as an Instructor or a Helper at a workshop
- [ ] Attend an Instructor Meeting, regional call, or other community event
- [ ] Submit a contribution to a Lesson, Glossario, or other Carpentries repository


### How will the Checkout steps be tracked?
**For the "Get Involved" step trainees must login to AMY to report which participation option they have completed.** Teaching Demonstrations and Welcome Sessions will be tracked automatically based on data shared by session hosts.  This includes events where attendance is taken (e.g. a regional call) -- it is still necessary to login and report that event as your choice for the Get Involved step. 


## FAQ
### I am currently in the process of completing checkout. What are my options?
You can choose to follow the old ways or the new ways!

| Checkout Step                 | If not yet completed                                                                                                              | If previously completed          |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Teaching demo        | Only required to prepare 1 episode                                                                                            | Counts as Teaching Demonstration |
| Community Discussion | Sign up for a Welcome Session (or see more FAQ below)       | May count as Get Involved step or Welcome Session (but not both)|
| Lesson contribution    | Select an option from the Get Involved recommendations                                                                     | Counts as Get Involved step |


### I am in the process of completing checkout and have already finished my Community Discussion requirement. How will that be recorded?
If you have already attended a Community Discussion (or other commumity event) as part of checkout, we have automatically transferred this activity to complete your Welcome Session step.

This means:
- You do not need to attend a Welcome Session unless you want to.
- If you do attend a Welcome Session, we will use the Welcome Session towards your Welcome Session requirement and the previously attended community Discussion to complete your Get Involved step.

### I am in the process of completing checkout and I don't want to attend a welcome session. 
**Community Discussion attendance will be accepted for the next 90 days [Eli: include the specific date] as a means to fulfill the Welcome Session step.** However, from this point forward, Community Discussion attendance will **not** automatically be counted towards this step because some trainees will choose to submit these for their "Get Involved" step instead. If you would like to have a Community Discussion that is not a welcome session counted for your welcome session, please contact us at instructor.training@carpentries.org.


### I am experiencing a barrier to accessibility during the Instructor checkout process. How can I get help?
We want to help! Please use our [accommodation request form](https://carpentries.typeform.com/to/B2OSYaD0) and a member of our team will get back to you. 

### I was trained a long time ago and never completed checkout. These new rules seem more achievable to me. Can I re-start my checkout process?
These changes are being made, in part, because we recognize that the challenges of our checkout process have prevented skilled and enthusiastic Instructors from completing their certification. However, it is also important that trainees begin their Instructor role with Carpentries training and ethos fresh in their mind. For the next 90 days, we will offer the following accommodations for anyone previously trained:
- **If you attended an Instructor Training event after 1 January 2022,** you may [email us](mailto:instructor.training@carpentries.org) to request a 90-day extension on your time to complete checkout. 
- **If you attended an Instructor Training event before 1 January 2022,** you may [email us](mailto:instructor.training@carpentries.org) to request a Carpentries-sponsored code to re-take Instructor Training. If you have been highly active in Carpentries activities during this period (e.g. as a Helper or non-certified co-Instructor), you may share a list of those activities and ask for a 90-day extension instead.

### I have another question! How can I get an answer?
Have a look at our new **#checkout-support** channel on Slack. Someone might have already asked your question, so the answer may be there! If not, consider sharing your question there for others to find. Depending on the question and time of day, you may receive a reply immediately or within 1 business day. You can [join The Carpentries Slack using this link](https://swc-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/).

For more detailed or personal questions, please [email our Instructor Training team](mailto:instructor.training@carpentries.org).
