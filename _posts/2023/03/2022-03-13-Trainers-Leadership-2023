In February, the [Trainer](https://carpentries.org/trainers/) community held its third annual election for 
[Trainers Leadership](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/blob/main/governance.md), a Committee that 
provides governance and development support to our growing subcommunity of Instructor Trainers, and makes 
decisions on behalf of that community that affect our Instructor Training program and related policies.

In their second year as an elected body, the Trainers Leadership Committee (TLC!) oversaw many important changes. These included:

* The first implementation of the Certification Renewal process approved by the Trainer community in 2021. The careful oversight of 
Leadership made this a successful milestone, balancing goals to maintain a community that is active, sustainable, and inclusive.
* Creation of a transparent process for proposal and scheduling of Trainer meetings and topics. This lays a foundation for increased community influence on 
and support for meetings that provide enriching and timely development opportunities.
* Design and approval of recommendations to make changes to the Instructor Checkout process, based on a broad community assessment project 
implemented in 2022. The 2023 Leadership will be working with Core Team to plan implementation, with some changes tentatively scheduled for June.
* Creation of more inclusive procedures for this committee, including use of asynchronous commenting and voting to achieve quorum. The challenge of 
operating groups with global representation is significant for all Carpentries subcommunities, and this group aims to create a model for 
procedures that are both effective and manageable for our volunteer participants in all time zones.
* Updating community documentation to better reflect policies and procedures, including changes to the Certification Renewal process and 
documentation for this Committee. These changes were presented to the full community and ratified during the election in February.

Details on these and other accomplishments of this Committee are available in the 
[reports](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/tree/main/reports) and [issues](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues) sections on the 
Trainers repository.


## Our 2023 Trainers Leadership panel is:


### Mark Crowe 

Mark Crowe is the Skills Development Manager for QCIF in Queensland, Australia, where he manages a team of research computing support professionals who 
offer training, coaching, and advice to researchers from all seven Queensland universities. He is a recent but enthusiastic convert to the Carpentries, 
first learning about it less than three years ago, and is working to encourage the further adoption of Carpentries approaches throughout Australia and 
the surrounding regions.

### Paola Corrales 

Paola is a Ph.D. student at the University of Buenos Aires. She is part of the latinamerican community where she has contributed to translations 
projects of Carpentriesâ€™ materials and organize Instructor Training events in Spanish. She is a professor at the Data Sciences degree and postgraduate 
courses at Guillermo Brown University. She also develops openly licensed materials to teach and learn R and other tools. She is excited to be part of 
the leadership teams and to bring a different perspective. She looks forward to hearing from other trainers about their experience and how to keep 
growing the community.

### Annajiat Alim Rasel

I am Annajiat Alim Rasel, a Sr. Lecturer at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering under the School of Data and Sciences (SDS), 
Brac University, Bangladesh. I usually teach problem-solving skills using Java and Python while trying to explore the exciting fields of 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Parallel, Distributed, and High-Performance Computing (HPC). I feel privileged to be a part of The 
Carpentries community and am trying to gain more knowledge, skills, and experience. It is amazing to work on Open Source materials and 
good teaching practices. We hope to build a Carpentries community in Bangladesh. We are trying to learn more about FAIR and CARE principles 
while trying to promote diversity, localization, and accessibility.



### Nathaniel Porter 
I am the Social Science Data Consultant and Data Education Coordinator in the Virginia Tech University Libraries and Affiliated Research Faculty 
in Sociology. In addition to coordinating the Carpentries at VT, I provide workshops, guest instruction and assistance in a variety of quantitative 
and qualitative research methods and software. My research interests include data collection best practices for surveys and survey experiments, 
data pedagogy, social science research replicability, and using non-traditional data for quantitative analysis. When I started in my role, we had 
a small group of Carpentries trainers and occasional workshops; becoming involved and building our instructor community has allowed us to scale 
to providing instruction to hundreds of learners each year and collaborating with departments and programs for specialized training.
