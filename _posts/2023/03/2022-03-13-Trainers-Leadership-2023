In February, the [Trainer](https://carpentries.org/trainers/) community held its third annual election for 
[Trainers Leadership](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/blob/main/governance.md), a Committee that 
provides governance and development support to our growing subcommunity of Instructor Trainers, and makes 
decisions on behalf of that community that affect our Instructor Training program and related policies.

In their second year as an elected body, the Trainers Leadership Committee (TLC!) oversaw many important changes. These included:

* The first implementation of a backwards-looking Certification Renewal process for Trainers. Their care and 
attention was insstrumental in making this important step towards maintaining an active, sustainable, and inclusive community a success.
* Design and approval of recommendations to make changes to the Instructor Checkout process, based on a broad community assessment project 
implemented in 2022. These changes will be implemented in 2023, with oversight by this year's Committee.
* Updating community documentation to better reflect policies and procedures, including changes to the Certification Renewal process and 
documentation for this Committee. These changes were presented to the full community and ratified during the election in February.

Details on these and other accomplishments of this Committee are available in the 
[reports](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/tree/main/reports) and [issues](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues) sections on the 
Trainers repository.

the surrounding regions.
