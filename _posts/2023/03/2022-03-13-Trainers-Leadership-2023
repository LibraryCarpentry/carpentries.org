In February, the [Trainer](https://carpentries.org/trainers/) community held its third annual election for 
[Trainers Leadership](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/blob/main/governance.md), a Committee that 
provides governance and development support to our growing subcommunity of Instructor Trainers, and makes 
decisions on behalf of that community that affect our Instructor Training program and related policies.

In their second year as an elected body, the Trainers Leadership Committee (TLC!) oversaw many important changes. These included:

* Establishing meeting procedures, adopting a variation on Martha’s Rules, identifying ways to use public and private channels to prioritize 
transparency, and creating GitHub templates and other structures to facilitate future work.
* Reviewing and planning a replacement for the (former) Trainer Agreement. A new proposal for a 
[Certification Renewal Process](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_training/duties_agreement.html#certification-renewal-process) for 
Trainers was presented to the full community and ratified during the election in February.
* Detailing governance and management structure for relevant processes, including oversight of Instructor checkout, Instructor Training 
curriculum maintenance, and the process of scheduling Trainer community meetings.
* Overseeing a [major update to the Instructor Training Curriculum](https://carpentries.org/blog/2021/11/IT-curriculum-update/)
* Defining a decision-making partnership with the Trainer community. Conversations so far suggest that Leadership is trusted and expected 
to take responsibility for action, reserving community consultation for focused, impactful choices. 
* Seeking and receiving approval from The Carpentries Executive Council as a formal Committee! This took time because this group has a governance role, 
making it different from other [Committees](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/committee-policy.html#the-carpentries-committee-policy), 
and there were not yet any guidelines for that aspect of their role. Trainers Leadership will continue to report to the EC as a Committee, but they 
can also now look to the new [Lesson Program Governance policies](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/lesson-program-policy.html#lesson-programs) where applicable.

Details on these and other accomplishments of this Committee are available in the 
[reports](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/tree/main/reports) and [issues](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/issues) sections on the 
Trainers repository.


## Our 2023 Trainers Leadership panel is:


### Mark Crowe 

Mark Crowe is the Skills Development Manager for QCIF in Queensland, Australia, where he manages a team of research computing support professionals who 
offer training, coaching, and advice to researchers from all seven Queensland universities. He is a recent but enthusiastic convert to the Carpentries, 
first learning about it less than three years ago, and is working to encourage the further adoption of Carpentries approaches throughout Australia and 
the surrounding regions.

### Paola Corrales 

Paola is a Ph.D. student at the University of Buenos Aires. She is part of the latinamerican community where she has contributed to translations 
projects of Carpentries’ materials and organize Instructor Training events in Spanish. She is a professor at the Data Sciences degree and postgraduate 
courses at Guillermo Brown University. She also develops openly licensed materials to teach and learn R and other tools. She is excited to be part of 
the leadership teams and to bring a different perspective. She looks forward to hearing from other trainers about their experience and how to keep 
growing the community.
