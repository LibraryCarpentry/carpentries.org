## Beta Phase to complete on 03 April, 2023

We are nearing the end of the Beta Phase, which means that the lessons below will switch to The Workbench view as the default.
In April, be on the lookout for community discussions about The Workbench where you can get an introduction about what to expect when we transition all of our lessons in May.

All of these lessons are now in the [second (beta) stage](https://carpentries.github.io/workbench/beta-phase.html#beta)

## Thank You, Lesson Template Contributors

I arrived at The Carpentries in March 2020, and by the time I got here, the lesson infrastructure (then known as the "Lesson Template") had already gone through [several iterations](https://github.com/carpentries/styles/releases/tag/v9.1.0). 

... this needs to be filled in ...

## Updates to The Carpentries Workbench

Since 2022-02-14, 

 - [{sandpaper} version 0.11.5 -> 0.11.8](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper/news/index.html#sandpaper-0118)
   - Packages from BioConductor can now be bootstrapped in new lessons.
   - The package {renv} updated to 0.17.0, which [introduced many new bugs](https://github.com/carpentries/sandpaper/issues/406),
     It is recommended to avoid updating {renv} until its next release is sent to CRAN.
     If you have already updated, please visit [sandpaper issue 406](https://github.com/carpentries/sandpaper/issues/406) for details.

   - No updates :)
 - [{varnish} version 0.2.14](https://carpentries.github.io/varnish/news/index.html#varnish-0214)
   - No updates :)

To update your local Workbench installation, open R and use the following code:

```r
# Enable repository from carpentries
options(repos = c(
  ropensci = 'https://carpentries.r-universe.dev',
  CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
# Download and install sandpaper in R
install.packages(c('tinkr', 'pegboard', 'sandpaper', 'varnish'))
```
