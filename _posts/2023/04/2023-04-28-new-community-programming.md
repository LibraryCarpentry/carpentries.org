A [blog post published in February 2023](https://carpentries.org/blog/2023/02/future-of-carpentrycon/) highlighted findings and four key recommendations from the most recent [CarpentryCon evaluation report](https://zenodo.org/record/7618406#.Y--TauzMJz8). In this post, it was announced that CarpentryCon would be pushed back by one year and would be hosted in South Africa in 2025 instead of 2024. The post also noted that, due to this schedule change, we would be introducing new opportunities to lead CarpentryCon-type programming year-round. We are excited to announce that the time has come!
