The role of [Instructor Trainer](https://carpentries.org/trainers/) (aka "Trainer," but different from "Instructor" in Carpentries lingo) 
has a very special place in The Carpentries. The Trainer community is much smaller than the Instructor community -- 
we have certified 147 Instructor Trainers in our history, compared with 4,161 certified Instructors! We train Instructor 
Trainers only **1-2 times per year**, based on our ability to meet global demand for Instructor Training and the interest of 
member organisations in supporting Trainers to enhance their local efforts. If this role interests you, be sure to apply now!


## About the Role

![A diagram of our Instructor Training program. Instructor Trainers are trained through Instructor Trainer Training and themselves teach Instructor Training to new Instructors. New Instructors teach Carpentries Workshops to learners.]({{ site.urlimg }}/blog/2020/07/instructor-training-program.png)
<br/>_A flow chart of our Instructor Training program, from Instructor Trainers to Instructors to Learners._

**Instructor Trainer Training** is the process by which we on-board new Instructor Trainers. **Instructor Trainers co-teach Instructor Training events** to bring on new Instructors.  **Instructors** teach Carpentries workshops (Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, and Software Carpentry) to learners worldwide.

## About Trainer Training

Trainer Training consists of 10 weekly 1-hour meetings, scheduled by polling. This cohort will start meetings on the earliest date practical, ideally after all local 
time changes have passed (late March or early April, depending on regional representation).

In addition to the weekly meetings, trainees are asked to sit in on part of an online Instructor Training event, observe a Teaching Demonstration session, and complete [weekly reading and homework assignments](https://carpentries.github.io/trainer-training/) from [The Carpentries Instructor Training Curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/) as well as our text, [How Learning Works](https://www.worldcat.org/title/how-learning-works-seven-research-based-principles-for-smart-teaching/oclc/762968489) by Ambrose et al. Trainees will need to purchase or borrow a copy of the text to use during the training. For more details, have a look at the [Becoming a Trainer section in The Carpentries Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_training/trainers_training.html#trainers-training-program).

## New to The Carpentries? Learn More at a Community Welcome Session

Trainers play a leading role in The Carpentries because they teach Instructors. However, all applicants who have appropriate background and interest 
in teaching about the theory and practice of great instruction are welcome to apply. Representatives from the Instructor Training team will be attending the 
Community Welcome Sessions on 22 March -- this is a great place to learn about The Carpentries community and ask questions about Trainer Training.

## The Application Process

We are so happy you want to join us as an Instructor Trainer! The application is [here](https://forms.gle/47zsFpx4u1K76VoR8). 
Please apply by the end of [February 27, 2023, AoE](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Trainer+Application+Deadline&iso=20230228T12&p1=1440).


## Selection Priorities

Applications are welcome from anyone who is interested! Several factors can influence acceptance, and these are good to know about before you apply.

### Purchased vs. Sponsored Seats

We have 2 main tiers for admission to this program. Like Instructor Training, we offer seats for purchase through 
[Membership](https://carpentries.org/membership/) as well as Carpentries-sponsored admission with no cost 
to trainees (note there is a required textbook that trainees must purchase if they cannot borrow from a library). 
Unlike Instructor Training, applicants for purchased seats are subject to review and must be approved by our panel of current Trainers.

All applicants must meet our basic expectations for Instructor Trainers with regard to **philosophy and skill in training and community-based work**. 
Teaching new Instructors about The Carpentries approach to training and community is a vital role that shapes the character and culture of our global 
community. For this reason, we aim to select applicants who will model our practices with care and engage thoughtfully with our growing community of 
Trainers as we continue to develop this program. Your application will help our panelists get to know you and appreciate the ways in which you are 
prepared to support our program.


Applicants for Carpentries-sponsored seats will be subject to competitive selection based on our panel's ranking of application responses. 
In addition, we consider the following criteria during our final selection process:


1. **Regional Training Opportunities.**

    When we onboard new Instructor Trainers, we want to be able to provide opportunities for you to teach! However, Instructor Training is 
    a limited program. We therefore prioritize applicants who are located in time zones or geographic areas where we have established training 
    needs or sponsorship goals. 
    **Note:** for geographic areas that rely exclusively on local training, proximity to another Instructor Trainer who can co-teach is 
    necessary as well.

2\. **Support for Existing Carpentries Communities.**

    Instructor Trainers often play important roles beyond teaching Instructor Training workshops, and this can be particularly valuable at the 
    local level. A local Carpentries community may benefit from having someone in the region who can consult on training practices and support 
    new Instructor trainees through the checkout process and beyond. Furthermore, Trainers from established communities can share their community 
    practices with other regional and global Carpentries communities through this role. For these reasons, we  prioritize Trainers who aim to support 
    existing local communities.


Our selection priorities do change each round, and highly qualified applicants may be declined due to small cohort size. Repeat applications are 
very welcome and are often more successful in subsequent rounds.


## Instructor Trainer FAQ

**Do I need to be a certified Carpentries Instructor to apply?**

No. Many applicants are certified Instructors with experience teaching Carpentries workshops. However, this is not always the case â€” 
many otherwise strong applicants have not had an opportunity to be involved as an Instructor yet. Applicants who are not certified 
Instructors should have some prior training in educational best practices, and should be informed and excited about being involved 
with The Carpentries.

If you are not a certified Instructor, the application will direct you to apply for Instructor Training and complete it concurrently.

**What responsibilities will I have as an Instructor Trainer?**

Instructor Trainers are invited to:
- co-teach 2-day (or 4-half-day) Carpentries Instructor Training workshops (recommended 2 per year)
- host 1-hr online teaching demonstration sessions (recommended 4 per year)
- follow curriculum-related conversations and updates on GitHub
- attend monthly meetings (recommended at least 4 per year), and check notes for community updates when not attending
- vote in annual Trainer community elections

Other participation and service to the Trainers and broader Carpentries communities can contribute towards meeting the expectations 
for continuing engagement as an active Instructor Trainer.  

Trainers are asked to renew their certification annually by participating in the community as outlined above, and may choose to take 
leave from their role if they are not able to remain active. Expectations and renewal procedures are determined by the 
Trainer community and updates are being supported by [Trainers Leadership](https://carpentries.org/blog/2022/05/Trainers-Leadership-2022/). 
For more details on current expectations, see the [The Carpentries Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_training/duties_agreement.html).

**What impact will I have as an Instructor Trainer?**

Trainers are critical leaders in The Carpentries community. In addition to training and welcoming our future Carpentries Instructors, 
Trainers are asked to guide the development of The Carpentries Instructor Training curriculum and program more broadly. There are many 
ways to take on leadership both formally and informally, and the voice of new Trainers is especially important to making the community 
welcoming for all. Bring your voice to the table, and help us create the future of The Carpentries!

Trainers often also lead within their home communities, spearheading institutional memberships and supporting community organisation efforts. 
Trainers may share knowledge and expertise with their home communities in many ways. It is important to note, however, that Trainers cannot 
host official Instructor Training events or send any trainees for Instructor certification without prior approval from The Carpentries. 
Trainers are encouraged to explore [membership](https://carpentries.org/membership/) or inquire about Carpentries-sponsored opportunities 
on behalf of any groups they would like to train as Carpentries Instructors.

**Any questions?**

We want to hear from you! Please bring questions to one of our meetings (above) or email The Carpentries 
Instructor Training Team at [instructor.training@carpentries.org](mailto:instructor.training@carpentries.org).
