You're invited to a code sprint for the [Intro to AI for GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums) Library Carpentry lesson ](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/machine-learning-librarians-archivists/) on January 31, 2024! The lesson maintainers and the [LC Curriculum Advisory Committee](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/curriculum-advisors) are co-hosting an open online sprint for anyone in the Carpentries community who wants to help contribute bug fixes, edits, and improvements to this important new lesson. The lesson introduces artificial intelligence topics and tools to galleries, libraries, archives, and museum staff. This is a great way to engage with the Library Carpentry community - all are welcome!
