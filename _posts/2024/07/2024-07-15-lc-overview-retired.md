### Introduction
The Library Carpentry Overview lesson was recently moved to the "Retired Curriculum" section of the [Library Carpentry (LC) lessons page](https://librarycarpentry.org/lessons/). [The Tidy Data lesson](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-spreadsheets/) was moved to "Core Curriculum" and is now the recommended introductory lesson for LC core workshops. 

The Library Carpentry Curriculum Advisory Committee (LC-CAC) worked with the maintainers of the LC Overview lesson—Jesse Johnston, Ravyn Manuel, and Elizabeth McAulay—to plan the deprecation of the lesson.

### Why the lesson was retired
The Library Carpentry Overview lesson provided a snapshot of LC’s history and its relevance to library and information science audiences along with a few activities for learners, such as Jargon Busting. The LC-CAC, in discussion with the lesson maintainers, found that there was no longer a need for most learners to be introduced to LC during a workshop, and that many workshops were opting instead to teach the Tidy Data lesson. LC-CAC reviewed the lesson and found that many of the episodes would be more useful in presentations about LC than as part of an introduction to an LC workshop. LC-CAC reviewed the content from the lesson to ensure that useful episodes would be retained elsewhere in the LC curriculum, and retired the Overview lesson from the Core curriculum. 

### How the lesson was retired
LC-CAC worked with the lesson maintainers, with significant contributions from Elizabeth McAulay, to identify a path to retire the LC Overview lesson. We identified valuable content from the Overview lesson, such as the Jargon Busting activity, to integrate into other LC curriculum. We also outlined a number of steps to move the lesson out of the curriculum. 
- The Tidy Data lesson was moved to the Core curriculum and is currently the recommended introductory lesson for LC core workshops. 
- The LC Overview lesson was moved to the “Retired Curriculum” section of the lessons page, for posterity’s sake. 
- The Jargon Busting activity was updated and added to the Tidy Data lesson [as an optional exercise](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-spreadsheets/00-intro.html#jargon-busting-optional-not-included-in-timing). The activity will also be added as an optional exercise in a new alpha lesson, Introduction to Computational Thinking.
- Given the lesson’s focus on the Library Carpentry program itself, it did not make sense to move the repository to the Carpentries Incubator, where retired lessons are typically migrated. Instead, the GitHub repository will be archived. 
- The entire lesson was captured as a PDF and [archived in Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11402855).

We invite other LC lesson maintainers to integrate content from the Overview lesson as they see fit.

### Course author biographies
- Cody Hennesy is the Computational Research Librarian at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, where he supports researchers with reproducible and methodologically sound practices to collect and analyze library and open digital collections. He is a member of the LC-CAC.
- Tim Dennis, the Director of the Data Science Center at UCLA Library, specializes in helping researchers and students apply computational and data methods. His work focuses on increasing access, supporting activism-minded research, and transforming data services through inclusive pedagogy and expanded familiarity with open source software.
