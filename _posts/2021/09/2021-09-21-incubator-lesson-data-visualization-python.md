The Incubator Lesson Spotlight highlights a lesson under development by our community in [The Carpentries Incubator][incubator]. In this edition, we look at the progress being made on [the _{{page.lesson_title}}_ lesson][lesson-pages], and hear from the authors about how The Carpentries community can get involved with the ongoing development of this lesson.

## Lesson Profile

* **Title:** {{page.lesson_title}}
* **Lesson Pages:** https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-interactive-data-visualizations/
* **Lesson Repository:** https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/python-interactive-data-visualizations

### Learning Objectives

1. How to wrangle data into the right format for creating visualizations using the pandas library (and about Tidy Data)
2. How to create some basic visualizations using the Plotly Express library
3. How to create a web app for interacting with the visualizations using the Streamlit library

### Target Audience

Learners who have recently completed the "Plotting and Programming in Python" lesson (or have some experience with Python and pandas) and want to learn more about data visualizations - and building interactive "dashboards".

## Lesson Progress

The lesson is in a finished state - all of the lessons are written and there are exercises included. I have taught the lesson once earlier in its development. It's now ready to be taught by other instructors (but has not yet been taught by other instructors), and I am looking forward to their feedback on the lesson. There are some instructor notes on that extras page. The lesson is currently in "Alpha" stage.

## How You Can Help Develop This Lesson

I would like for other instructors to teach the lesson and provide feedback on the experience, especially as regards pacing, clarity, and points where learners struggled.

To contact me directly regarding questions, email me at jenna.jrdn@gmail.com. If there's a problem with the lesson, then submit an issue to the GitHub repo.
